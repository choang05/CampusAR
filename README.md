Makerspace UH is part of an effort to gain interest from STEM and Non-STEM majors to learn about technology and what it can do for society as a whole. Makerspace UH is supervised by the Library and the Electrical and Computer Engineering department to oversee projects. We hold a series of events such as workshops based on Arduino, CCS, and Hardware setups to teach those who have no outlet with all the necessary resources. The biggest event we hold is Build-a-Bot that caters towards those who do not have much experience with coding and robotics by having students and professionals experienced in the subject to teach students, to put their skills to the test a competition is held at the end to give them the competitive spirit. Among other things Makerspace ECE has the primary goal of creating projects done by students to showcase at the ECEDHA Conference every year. This is to demonstrate what our students can do such as an Art piece that is a 3d printed replica of the campus that utilizes wireless charging and AR to bring in the newest technologies.
